# BeautyBlend App - Backend Development

BeautyBlend App is a backend service project that I developed for a makeup company. It enhances their online presence by showcasing interactive photo galleries. The backend is built using Spring Boot framework and utilizes a PostgreSQL database for efficient data management.

## Features

- **Photo Upload:** Users can upload high-quality photos of makeup products, makeup looks, and more.
- **Photo Galleries:** Organized and interactive galleries to display the uploaded photos.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
- **API Endpoints:** RESTful API endpoints for uploading, retrieving, and managing photos.
- **Database Integration:** PostgreSQL database integration for reliable and efficient data storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Spring Security
- **API Design:** RESTful principles
- **Documentation:** Swagger

## Getting Started

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the database configuration in the application properties file.
3. Run the Spring Boot application.
4. Use tools like Postman or Swagger to interact with the API endpoints.
